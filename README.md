# pyDataverse

[![Project Status: Unsupported â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but the author(s) have ceased all work on it. A new maintainer may be desired.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

pyDataverse is a Python module for [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org).
It helps to access the Dataverse [API's](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/index.html) and manipulate, validate, import and export all Dataverse data-types (Dataverse, Dataset, Datafile).

## Running the tests

To run pyDataverse's tests locally, you need to install docker and docker-compose. This will spin up a local Dataverse instance and run the tests against it. You can run the tests with:

```bash
sh run_tests.sh
```

By default local tests are using the python `3.11` slim image. However, you can change the python version by providing a valid version via the `-p` keyword argument. For example, to run the tests with python `3.9`:

```bash
sh run_tests.sh -p 3.9
```
